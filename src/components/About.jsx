          I started my coding journey with Competitive Programming as a member of my high school VOI team.
          Solving problems has always been intriguing to me, the process of dissecting complex problems,
          breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts, and finally connecting them together has 
          always felt incredibly satisfying. That's why I enjoy diving into learning algorithms.
